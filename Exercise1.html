<h3>Exercise 1</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Create a button written click</li>
    <li>Create a button with your name and another one with your favourite food. They must be beside each other</li>
    <li>Create a paragraph that is written "Hello World", then in a new line create another one where you talk about what you did today.</li>
</ol>
<!--Note that when defining an ordered or unordered list you do the following:-->
<!--You open the ul tag for an unordered list  or the ol tag for an ordered list-->
<!--Then you list the elements of the list using the li tag. For each element of the list you open the li tag then close it.-->
<!--After listing all the elements using the li tag, you can then close the ul tag for unordered list or the ol tag for an ordered list.-->
<!--What you do not do is to open the ol tag or ul tag for every element of the list hoping it will show,it won't.-->
