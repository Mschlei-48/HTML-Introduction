<!--Now we will be learning about adding hovers, which  are the changes that happen to a button or whatever element-->
<!--when you hover over them. Some buttons may change color, some may become light in color some may become dark in color.-->
<!--We will add these changes to the buttons we had before-->
<h2>Hovers,Transitions and Shadows</h3>
<p>Buttons to apply these to:</p>

/*Note that the hover and active are called pseudo classes. They add extra styling to the element when something happens, like when you hover or touch/activate the element/button.*/
/*Now we will use the hover pseudo class to make the button light when we hover it using the opacity property.*/
/*The opacity property defines how transparent an element is. It uses values between 0 and 1. A 0 means the eleent will be completely opaque, it will be invisible*/
/* THen a 1 makes the element less opaque or not opaque at all.*/
/*So numbers close to zero make the element very opaque, but those closer to zero make the element less opaque.*/
/*In our case we want the element button to be a little bit opaque like the real YouTube buttn when you hover it, so in that case a 0.7 will be used.*/

        /*Then when it is clicked, we will show the tick, and place it at the middle of the button to show that the button has been clicked.*/
