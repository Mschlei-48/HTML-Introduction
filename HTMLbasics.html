<!--How to create an achor element?-->
<!--An anchor element is an element that allows us to put links to other websites.-->
<!--An anchor element is created with an a tag. In the following line we create an achor element-->
<a>Hey there. Click here to go to YouTube</a> <br>  <!--The text inside the anchor tag is the text that will be shown on the link. When the person clicks on the text they will be redirected to the website whos link is on the anchor tag.-->
<!--Now the link is put in an HTML attribute. Without the link the text in teh anchor tag will not do anything. So we need a link, and the link has to be put in an HTML attribute-->
<!--HTML attributes are used to provide extra information or instructions added to HTML elements to change or enhance their behaviour or appearance.-->
<!--An example of a case where HTML attributes are used to enhance the behaviour of an HTML elements is with the anchor tag.-->
<!--The anchor tag needs the href attribute so that when a person clicks on the text of the anchor tag the anchor tag behaves in such a way that the person is redirected to another website. Without the href attribute, the tag would not act this way-->
<!--An instance where the HTML attrobute is used to change the appearance of an HTML elemnent content is when we use the width HTML attribute which specifies how wide a certain content of a certain element should be.-->
<!--So in our case since we want the anchor tag to redirect to anotehr website, we will give the href HTM attribute and out the link there. href stands for hyperlink reference.-->
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/">Hey there. Click here to go to YouTube.</a><br>
<!--Now note that when you click on the link, the YouTube link opens in the current tab. No new tab is opened.-->
<!--This can be changed using another attribute called target. Note that a tag can have many attrbutes. In this case our anchor tag will have two attrobutes, the href and the target attributes.-->
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/" target="blank">Click here to go to YouTube on a seperate blank tab!</a> <!--The blank means the link should be opened on a blank/empty tab.-->
<!--Note that certain attributes can only be used in certain elements. For example href and target can only be used with the anchor element.-->
